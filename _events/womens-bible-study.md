Join us for the exciting Old Testament story of Queen Esther, a biography of courage with many modern parallels for today's overloaded and stressed woman. Esther, while a queen, lived as an outsider in a hostile environment. We will learn strong lessons of faith, providence, and hope and be equipped to live them out courageously "for such a time as this"!
